# NMAI NK360 Interactives

### Project structure
TODO: Add in details on project structure.

##### Shared assets
In the root project directory is a shared folder containing assets we can use for multiple interactives. This may include Sass files, images/assets, written content, or JavaScript files.

##### Grunt
There is a single Gruntfile that will run a local webserver with watch command `grunt` and a distribution script for going live `grunt dist`. During development, you can use the former majority of the time and navigate to your project's root. The latter should just be used to minify and package everything up.

##### Commenting
As you go, be sure to comment your code to make sure it's clear. Write a short description of all functions (even if they seem obvious) and define each Sass file at the top of the file with a short description of what you might find in that folder. Use the following comment format where possible (include a short description of the function/file, and where appropriate, define the arguments and returned values):

```
/**
 * A short description of what this function/file does
 * @param {string|int|array} [argument] Description
 * @return {string|int|array} Description

```

##### Refactoring
This project will be delivered to the web development team at NMAI for integration, so refactor often to clean out code cruft and improve code. Add comments in, clean up file structure. There should be no JavaScript or CSS in HTML files!

### Unit testing
We'll be setting up unit tests using [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) to confirm functionality continues to work as the interactives are built and changes are made. For an introduction to unit testing, please read QUnit's [Intro to Unit Testing](http://qunitjs.com/intro/) and the QUnit [Cookbook](http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/).

##### Setting up tests
In each interactive's project folder, there is a test directory. For each function/method, there should be a test HTML file that runs through each aspect of that function to ensure that any data or DOM manipulation still runs successfully. As you build project features, be sure to write your tests as you go.
