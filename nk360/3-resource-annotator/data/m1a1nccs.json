He had traveled a long way, deep into the heart of the Black Hills Country, where he seemed to be called by some great power. At last he reached a mountain known ever since by the Cheyennes as Noahvoses, the Sacred Holy Mountain; today it is called Bear Butte. Here he entered and found a big lodge or teepee. Old women were sitting along one side and old men along the other. But they were not really people, they were gods. And he saw four arrows there, which were to become the Four Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne tribe.</p><p>The old ones called him Grandson and began instructing him in many things he should take back to the people. They taught him first about the arrows, because they were to be the highest power in the tribe. Two were for hunting and two for war. Many ceremonies were connected with them, and they stood for many laws…</p><p>Sweet Medicine learned next that he was to give the people a good government, with forty-four chiefs to manage it and a good system of police and military protection, organized in the four military societies—the Swift Foxes, Elks, Red Shields, and Bowstrings.”</p>",
